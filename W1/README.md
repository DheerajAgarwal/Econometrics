# Week 1: Regression

This week covers the fundamentals of simple regression. The repo contains:

1. Four (4) training exercises and
2. One (1) graded assignment notebok.


_Note:_  

1.  The training exercise was not solved using notebooks because it did not involve any code and could have been done with Mathjax alone.
2. The entire solution is based on using Python3.
