# Week 2: Multiple Regression

This week covers the fundamentals of multiple regression. The repo contains:

1. TWO training exercises which needed code to solve and  
2. ONE graded assignment [notebok](https://github.com/DheerajAgarwal/Econometrics/blob/master/W2/Week_2_Multiple_Regression_GradedAssignment.ipynb) or [pdf](https://github.com/DheerajAgarwal/Econometrics/blob/master/W2/Week_2_Multiple_Regression_GradedAssignment.pdf)


_Note:_  

1.  Some training exercises was not solved using notebooks if it does not involve any code or programing.
2. The entire solution is based on using Python3.
